          <hr class="my-4" />
          <p>
            Greetings! I'm Lucas, a passionate computer scientist on the verge
            of completing my postbaccalaureate degree in Computer Science at
            Oregon State University. My journey into the world of technology has
            been exhilarating, with a particular focus on mastering a diverse
            range of programming languages and tools. I'm eager to continue this
            journey after working as a trombone player in the Bay Area for
            several years.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">Technical Expertise</h2>
          <p>
            My expertise lies in harnessing the power of Python, SQL, MongoDB,
            JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and C to craft innovative solutions to
            complex problems. I thrive in the world of open-source technologies,
            and my proficiency in Linux is a testament to my commitment to the
            open-source ethos. I am well-versed in deploying applications on
            Linux platforms, utilizing custom-built Continuous
            Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure
            seamless and efficient releases. All of the projects listed below
            which include a "Live" link are either deployed on a Linode Ubuntu
            server, or are hosted from my living room on a Raspberry Pi 4
            running Ubuntu Server.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">Problem Solver and Innovator</h2>
          <p>
            I am not just a programmer; I am a problem solver and an innovator.
            I relish challenges and am constantly seeking opportunities to push
            the boundaries of what technology can achieve. My ability to think
            critically and creatively has allowed me to conceptualize and
            implement unique solutions, enhancing user experiences and driving
            technological advancements.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">Continuous Learning</h2>
          <p>
            In the fast-paced world of technology, continuous learning is key. I
            am deeply committed to staying updated with the latest trends,
            tools, and methodologies in the ever-evolving realm of computer
            science. My dedication to lifelong learning ensures that I am always
            equipped with the most cutting-edge skills, enabling me to tackle
            even the most intricate of problems with confidence and finesse.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4">Experience</h2>
          <h3>Internship at Cvent</h3>
          <p>
            During my internship at Cvent, I had the opportunity to work with
            TypeScript and React, focusing on SLI (Service Level Indicator)
            metrics. Being part of a dynamic Scrum team, I honed my skills in
            collaborative software development, contributing to meaningful
            projects and learning valuable insights into agile methodologies.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-4">Musical Background</h3>
          <p>
            In a previous chapter of my life, I pursued a career in music, which
            deeply enriched my ability to collaborate with others. This
            experience instilled in me the importance of teamwork,
            communication, and creativity, skills that I carry forward into my
            work as a computer scientist. While my focus has shifted to the
            world of technology, my musical background continues to influence my
            approach to problem-solving and innovation.
